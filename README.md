# Card-Game-in-C++
This program models a Deck of Playing Cards consisting of 52 cards. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck.
* There must be 4 suits: Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds.
* Each suit must contain 13 cards numbered 2 - 10, Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K), and Ace (A).


** print_deck function:
*** Prints the entire deck to standard out. Prints 4 rows of 13 cards each.

** shuffle function:
*** all 52 cards should be randomly permuted. This must use a seedable random number generator 

** sort function:
*** Sorts the deck from lowest to highest by suit then by card face value. 
*** The suits are valued from highest to lowest: Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds
*** The cards are valued from highest to lowest: King,Queen,Jack,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,Ace

** deal_hand function:
*** A deal function which prints N sets of M cards: The internal set of cards in the deck does not need to be altered. i.e. The deck doesn't 'lose' the cards it deals. Also, two consecutive 'deals' should produce the same result. 

I got this problem during an interview in December 2020. I found this problem very interestning thus I have upload the solution in Github.
